## Interpreter

- some programming problems are best solved by creating some specialized language and expressing a solution in theat language
- these problems tend to be self-contained, with crisp boundaries around them
  - searching for objects based on some specification: build a query language
  - creating complex object configurations: build a configuration language
  - creating lots of discrete chunks of code, which you find yourself combining in an ever expanding array of combinations

- uses ASTs (abstract syntax trees)
